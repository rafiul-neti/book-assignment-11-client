### Project Overview
BookCourier is a library delivery management system. It allows users to request book pickup or delivery from nearby libraries. The system helps students, researchers, and readers borrow and return books without physically visiting the library.

### Key Features
* Request Deliveries: Users can ask for books to be delivered to their location.
* Book Pickup: Users can schedule a time for books to be picked up and returned to the library.
* Map Integration: The app uses maps to help manage library locations and delivery routes.
* User Accounts: People can safely sign up and log in to manage their book requests.
* Mobile Friendly: The design works well on both mobile phones and desktop computers.
* Real-time Alerts: Users receive clear messages and notifications for their actions.
